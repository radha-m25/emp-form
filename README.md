## Form Validation
The form validation logic is implemented in the useForm custom hook located at src/hooks/useForm.js. The following fields are validated:

First name, Last name, and Address: Required fields that cannot be empty.
Date of Birth (DOB): Must be in the format DD/MM/YYYY and represent a valid date.
Phone Number: Must be exactly 10 digits long.
Email: Must be in a valid email format.
These validations ensure that users provide the correct information before submission.

## Styling
Global and component-specific styles are applied using CSS and Material-UI:

1. Global Styles: Defined in App.css and applied to the body for a gradient background and full-height layout.
Component Styles: Specific styles for the EmployeeForm component are defined in EmployeeForm.css.
Inline styles and Material-UI Button component are used in App.js to style the home page elements and form button.

## Navigation
React Router is used to handle navigation:

1. Home Page (/): Renders the main App component, which includes a heading and a button to navigate to the employee form.
2. Form Page (/form): Renders the EmployeeForm component, which includes the form to collect employee information.
